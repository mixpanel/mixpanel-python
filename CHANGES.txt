* Convert setup.py to pyproject.toml

v4.9.0

    Reinstate TLS cert validation by default. (#103)
* Drop support for Python 3.4 in setup.py and testing matrix.
* Update readme references to mixpanel-utils project. (#100)

v4.8.1
A compatibility bugfix -- 4.8.0 broke subclassing compatibility with some
  other libraries.

v4.8.0
* Add api_secret parameter to import_data and merge methods. API secret is the
    new preferred auth mechanism; the old API Key still works but is no longer
    accessible in the Mixpanel settings UI. (ref: issues #85, #88)
* Add optional verify_cert param to Consumer.__init__ for those having trouble
    with server cert validation.  (ref: issue #86)

v4.7.0
* Form $insert_id for track and import calls (if not present) to enable server-side event deduplication.
* Retry API calls upon connection or HTTP 5xx errors. Added new retry options to Consumer classes.
* Replaced urllib2-based HTTP calls with urllib3. This allows connection pooling as well at the aforementioned retries.
* Stop base64 encoding payloads, as Mixpanel APIs now support naked JSON.
* Bug: $time in people operations should be sent in seconds, not milliseconds.

* Add `$merge` support.
* Support for overriding API host for, say, making calls to EU APIs.
* Updates to `$alias` documentation.
